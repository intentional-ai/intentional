# Plugins

!!! warning

    Work in progress

Every layer of an Intentional bot that is configurable from the configuration file (interfaces, bot structures, LLM client, tools etc) can be expanded through a plugin.

## Writing your own plugins

To get started:

- Check the [Contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) for an idea of how to contribute a plugin to the main Intentional repo.
- You can host your plugins in your own repo, it's not necessary to have it merged in the main repo.
- You can use the Copier template under the plugins folder [here](https://github.com/intentional-ai/intentional/tree/main/plugins/.template).
